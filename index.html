    <h3> The Path She Followed </h3>
    <p>My name is Anahi Ruiz Robles(Pronouns: she, her) The first question I always get asked when meeting someone for the first time is "how do you pronounce it?". I was raised in North Hollywood, California. I am the oldest of five siblings and a born leader. I am not afraid to leap into a new chaledge. I enjoy everything fashion and welcome being outdoors but prefer to be a homebody at heart. I love meeting new people because everyone has a different story to tell with different experiences and challenges that make them unique.</p>
