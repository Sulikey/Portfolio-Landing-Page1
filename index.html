  <p> My name is Anahi Ruiz Robles <em>(Pronouns: she, her)</em> The first question 
      I always get asked when meeting someone for the first time is 
      "how do you pronounce it?". 
      I was raised in North Hollywood, California. 
      I am the oldest of five siblings and a born leader. 
      I am not afraid to leap into a new chaledge. 
      I enjoy everything fashion and welcome being outdoors 
      but prefer to be a homebody at heart. I love meeting new people because 
      everyone has a different story to tell with different experiences and 
      challenges that make them unique.
